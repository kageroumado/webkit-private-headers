/**
 * WKProcessStatePrivate.h
 * WebKitPrivateHeaders
 *
 * Private WebKit APIs for web process lifecycle monitoring.
 *
 * This header provides APIs for tracking the state of the web process
 * backing a WKWebView, enabling:
 * - Tab state indicators (running, suspended, crashed)
 * - Memory management decisions
 * - Crash recovery UI
 *
 * ## Process States
 * Web processes can be in one of four states:
 * - `NotRunning`: Process terminated, content discarded
 * - `Foreground`: Active with full resources
 * - `Background`: Running but deprioritized
 * - `Suspended`: Frozen, not executing code
 *
 * ## KVO Compliance
 * `_webProcessState` is KVO-compliant, but WebKit only sends notifications
 * when observers are registered. Without observers, state changes are silent.
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * All APIs must be called on the main thread.
 *
 * ## Source Reference
 * WebKit/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKWebViewPrivate.h
 *
 * Last verified: WebKit trunk (December 2024)

 * - Understanding which tabs are consuming resources
 * - Implementing tab discarding/restoration UI

/**
 * The current state of the web process.
 *
 * Use this to track whether a tab is loaded, suspended, or crashed.
 *
 * ## KVO Compliance
 * This property is KVO-compliant. Register an observer to receive
 * state change notifications:
 *
 * @code
 * [webView addObserver:self
 *           forKeyPath:@"_webProcessState"

 * ## Important
 * WebKit only sends KVO notifications when observers are registered.
 * If no observers exist, state changes are not broadcast. This is an
 * optimization to avoid unnecessary IPC when no one is listening.
