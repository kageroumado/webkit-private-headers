/**
 * WKThumbnailViewPrivate.h
 * WebKitPrivateHeaders
 *
 * Private WebKit API for efficient tab thumbnail generation.
 *
 * `_WKThumbnailView` is WebKit's internal mechanism for rendering scaled-down
 * snapshots of web pages, optimized for tab preview displays.
 *
 * ## Advantages Over takeSnapshot:
 * - Uses shared backing stores when possible (memory efficient)
 * - Renders at reduced resolution based on scale factor
 * - Automatic update handling when content changes
 * - Optimized for repeated use (tab switchers)
 *
 * ## Memory Management
 * The thumbnail view maintains its own backing store. For best performance:
 * - Set `exclusivelyUsesSnapshot = YES` for static previews
 * - Set `shouldKeepSnapshotWhenRemovedFromSuperview = YES` for caching
 * - Use appropriate `scale` values (0.25 is typical for tab thumbnails)
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * All APIs must be called on the main thread.
 *
 * ## Source Reference
 * WebKit/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/_WKThumbnailView.h
 * WebKit/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/_WKThumbnailView.mm
 *
 * Last verified: WebKit trunk (December 2024)

/**
 * A view that displays an efficient thumbnail of a WKWebView's content.
 *
 * This class renders a scaled-down version of a web view's content,
 * suitable for tab previews, visual bookmarks, or page overviews.
 *
 * ## Creation
 * @code
 * _WKThumbnailView *thumbnail = [[_WKThumbnailView alloc] initWithFrame:frame
 *                                                         fromWKWebView:webView];
 * thumbnail.scale = 0.25;
 * thumbnail.maximumSnapshotSize = CGSizeMake(320, 200);
 * thumbnail.exclusivelyUsesSnapshot = YES;
 * [containerView addSubview:thumbnail];
 * [thumbnail requestSnapshot];
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Snapshot Lifecycle
 * 1. Create thumbnail view with `initWithFrame:fromWKWebView:`
 * 2. Configure properties (scale, maxSize, etc.)
 * 3. Call `requestSnapshot` to capture content
 * 4. View updates automatically when snapshot is ready
 * 5. Call `requestSnapshot` again when content may have changed
 *
 * ## Automatic Deferral
 * If `requestSnapshot` is called while a snapshot is already being captured,
 * the new request is automatically deferred until the current one completes.
 * This prevents unnecessary duplicate work.
 *
 * ## Availability
 * macOS 10.10+ (macOS only, not available on iOS)

 * - When added to a window, automatically calls `requestSnapshot` if needed
 * - No connection to the source WKWebView's rendering layers
 * - Snapshot persists independently of the WKWebView's state
 * - Combined with `shouldKeepSnapshotWhenRemovedFromSuperview = YES`, snapshots remain cached
 *
 * ## When NO (Live mode):
 * - When added to a window, the WKWebView's actual CALayer sublayers are reparented into this view
 * - You see live web content, not a static image
 * - When removed from window or WKWebView disconnects, live layers are removed
 * - Falls back to snapshot ONLY if `layer.contents` has a cached image
 * - This mode is NOT suitable for caching - the "live" content disappears quickly
 *
 * ## IMPORTANT
 * The "gray view" problem occurs when using NO: the live layers disconnect but no
 * snapshot was cached. For tab previews and caching, always use YES.

/**

 *
 * ## Deferral Behavior
 * If called while a snapshot capture is in progress, the request is
 * automatically queued and processed when the current capture completes.
 * This prevents redundant work from rapid consecutive calls.
 *
 * ## When to Call
 * - After adding the view to the hierarchy
 * - After significant web content changes (navigation, scroll)
 * - When the web view becomes visible after being hidden
 *
 * ## Implementation Note
 * Internally, this calls `WebPageProxy::takeSnapshot()` with the configured
 * scale and size constraints.
