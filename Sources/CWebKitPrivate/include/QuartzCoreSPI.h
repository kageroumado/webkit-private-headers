/**
 * QuartzCoreSPI.h
 * WebKitPrivateHeaders
 *
 * Private QuartzCore/CoreAnimation APIs for advanced layer compositing.
 *
 * These APIs enable layer mirroring and remote layer hosting — essential
 * primitives for multi-window content display and cross-process compositing.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * - `CAPortalLayer`: Mirrors another layer's content without duplicating backing store
 * - `CALayerHost`: Hosts content from a remote CAContext (cross-process rendering)
 * - `CABackdropLayer`: Provides blur/vibrancy effects for translucent UI
 *
 * ## Typical uses
 *
 * `CAPortalLayer` is useful for:
 * - Displaying previews of live content without re-rendering
 * - Showing the same content in multiple windows (only one is interactive)
 * - Creating screen-share windows that mirror a single source layer
 *
 * ## References

/**
 * A layer that mirrors the visual content of another layer.
 *
 * `CAPortalLayer` displays a live copy of its `sourceLayer`'s content
 * without duplicating the backing store. This is ideal for thumbnails,
 * previews, and multi-view display of the same content.
 *
 * ## How It Works
 *
 * The portal layer creates a visual reference to the source layer's
 * composited content. When the source updates, the portal automatically
 * reflects those changes. No additional memory is consumed for the
 * mirrored content.
 *
 * ## Limitations
 *
 * - **Read-only**: Input events do not propagate to the source layer
 * - **Same process**: Source must be in the same process as the portal
 * - **Performance**: Many portals of the same source may impact compositing
 * - **Transforms**: Complex source transforms may not render correctly
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * @code
 * // Create a thumbnail of a WKWebView's content
 * CAPortalLayer *portal = [CAPortalLayer layer];
 * portal.sourceLayer = webView.layer;
 * portal.matchesTransform = YES;
 * portal.frame = thumbnailFrame;
 * [containerLayer addSublayer:portal];

#pragma mark - CABackdropLayer

/**
 * A layer that provides blur and vibrancy effects for content behind it.
 *
 * `CABackdropLayer` samples the content beneath it in the layer hierarchy
 * and applies visual effects like Gaussian blur. This is used for translucent
 * UI elements like sidebars, sheets, and popovers.
 *
 * ## How It Works
 *
 * The backdrop layer captures a snapshot of underlying content and applies
 * configurable filters. The result is composited beneath the layer's own
 * content, creating the "frosted glass" effect.
 *
 * ## Backdrop Groups
 *
 * Backdrop layers can be organized into groups using `groupName`. Layers in
 * the same group share a single backdrop capture, improving performance when
 * multiple translucent elements need the same background content.
 *
 * ## Performance
 *
 * Backdrop layers are GPU-accelerated but can be expensive when:
 * - The underlying content changes frequently
 * - Multiple backdrop layers overlap
 * - Large blur radii are used
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * @code
 * CABackdropLayer *backdrop = [CABackdropLayer layer];
