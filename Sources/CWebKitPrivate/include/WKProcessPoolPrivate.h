/**
 * WKProcessPoolPrivate.h
 * WebKitPrivateHeaders
 *
 * Private WebKit APIs for process pool management and per-process metrics.
 *
 * Provides access to:
 * - Per-process memory (physicalFootprint), CPU time, and state
 * - Process-to-WKWebView mapping (which tabs live in which process)
 * - Process termination and suspension queries
 * - GPU process information
 *
 * ## Key Types
 *
 * `_WKProcessInfo` — base class with pid, state, memory, CPU time.
 * `_WKWebContentProcessInfo` — extends with webViews array, content state,
 *   service/shared worker flags, and per-state time breakdowns.
 *
 * ## Memory Measurement
 *
 * `physicalFootprint` reports Mach `phys_footprint` — the same metric
 * Activity Monitor shows under "Memory" column. This is physical RAM
 * attributed to the process (dirty + compressed + purgeable-in-use),
 * excluding shared clean pages (dylibs, frameworks). Much more accurate
 * than `pti_resident_size` from proc_pidinfo which double-counts shared pages.
 *
 * ## Process Sharing
 *
 * WebKit uses process-per-origin by default, but multiple same-origin
 * tabs may share a process. The `webViews` array on each process info
 * reveals which WKWebViews share that process, enabling:
 * - Accurate process memory display (total for shared tabs)
 * - Estimated per-tab memory (processMemory / tabsInProcess)
 * - Visual grouping of tabs sharing a process
 *
 * ## Thread Safety
 * All APIs must be called on the main thread.
 *
 * ## Source Reference
 * WebKit/Source/WebKit/UIProcess/API/Cocoa/WKProcessPoolPrivate.h
 *
 * Last verified: WebKit trunk (March 2025)
